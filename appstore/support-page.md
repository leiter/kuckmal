## Frequently Asked Questions

### General

**What is Kuckmal?**
Kuckmal is an app that brings together content from all German public broadcasting media libraries (Mediatheken) in one place. Instead of switching between ARD, ZDF, Arte, and other apps, you can browse and search everything in Kuckmal.

**Is Kuckmal free?**
Yes, Kuckmal is completely free. There are no in-app purchases, subscriptions, or advertisements.

**Is Kuckmal affiliated with ARD, ZDF, or other broadcasters?**
No, Kuckmal is an independent aggregator app. All content is provided directly from the official media libraries of the public broadcasters.

### Content

**Why can't I play some videos?**
Some content from German public broadcasters is geo-restricted and may only be available within Germany, Austria, or Switzerland. If you see a geo-restriction warning, the content may not be playable in your current location.

**Why is some content not available?**
Content availability depends on the broadcasters' media libraries. Shows are typically available for a limited time after broadcast. Kuckmal shows what's currently available in each library.

**Can I download videos for offline viewing?**
The current version focuses on browsing and discovery. Video playback opens the content in the respective broadcaster's player.

### Technical

**The app shows "No data available"**
The app needs to download the film list on first launch. Ensure you have an internet connection and try refreshing. The download may take a moment as it contains information about thousands of shows.

**The app is not loading content**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try closing and reopening the app
3. If the problem persists, delete and reinstall the app

**How do I change the language?**
Kuckmal follows your device's language settings. The app interface is available in German and English. Content language depends on the broadcasters (primarily German).
